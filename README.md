Please go to https://towardsdatascience.com/making-music-when-simple-probabilities-outperform-deep-learning-75f4ee1b8e69 to read about what PopMusicMaker is, and how I built the machine. Youtube version is also available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeU5xzsqPmk&t=13s

Pop Music Maker built on Decision Tree and Hidden Markov Model-like structure. Inspired by the desire to build my own model that can rival LSTMS / deep learning in producing pop music
